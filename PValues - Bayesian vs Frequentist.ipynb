    "“The difference is that, in the Bayesian approach, the parameters that we are trying to estimate, are treated as random variables. In the frequentist approach, they are a fixed. Random variables are governed by their parameters (mean, variance, etc), and distributions (Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, etc). The prior is just the prior belief about these parameters. In this way, we can think of the Bayesian approach as treating probabilities as degrees of belief, rather than as frequencies generated by some unknown process”\n",
